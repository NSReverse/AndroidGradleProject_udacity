# Udacity's Android Gradle Project

The point of this task was to build a project utilizing Gradle when:
1. Importing Libraries (Java/Android)
2. Working with GCE
3. Creating Paid/Free flavors.
4. Making test tasks.

### Working with the GCE Module (jokebackend)

If you're working on a physical device, you must supply your server's own IP address so that the app can correctly connect to it. The IP address is set in res/values/strings.xml.

Once you're ready to start the app:
1. Launch this module
2. Start the app.
